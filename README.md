Passionate about mathematics and development since my teenage years, I have built my skills as a self-taught programmer with expertise in Python, JavaScript, Go, and PowerShell. These skills allow me to create innovative automation solutions, some of which have gained recognition from my current employer.

Today, in my role as a technician, I develop and implement technical solutions that add significant value to my team. My background in development enables me to solve complex problems and improve team efficiency.

I am continuously learning and evolving, with a growing interest in artificial intelligence, a field in which I plan to start my own projects in 2025.

Key Skills:
- Development in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, PowerShell
- Process automation and development of innovative solutions
- Applied mathematics and problem-solving
- Self-directed learning, adaptability, structured approach

I'm always open to connecting with professionals who share my vision for innovative projects and to exploring new opportunities that allow me to further develop my skills and contribute value.
